    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates speech diarization - the process of identifying \"who spoke when\" in an audio recording. We'll use this to analyze speaking time distribution in media, which can reveal potential biases and give context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Diarization?\n",
    "- **Transcription** = converting speech to text\n",
    "- **Diarization** = identifying different speakers\n",
    "- **My Goal** = measure speaking time, interruptions, and speaking patterns to detect media bias\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps:\n",
    "1. Load and transcribe audio with WhisperX\n",
    "2. Perform speaker diarization\n",
    "3. Align transcription with speaker labels\n",
    "4. Calculate speaking time statistics\n",
