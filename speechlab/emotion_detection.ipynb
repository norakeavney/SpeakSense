    "# Emotion & Tone Detection in Speech\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This notebook extends our diarization work by analyzing **how** things are said, not just **what** is said and **who** said it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It'll detect:\n",
    "- **Emotions**: Angry, happy, sad, neutral, fearful, disgusted, surprised\n",
    "- **Tone features**: Pitch, energy, speaking rate\n",
    "- **Per-speaker patterns**: Does the interviewer sound hostile? Is the guest defensive?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters for Bias Detection\n",
    "- **Hostile questioning** = aggressive tone, interruptions\n",
    "- **Softball interviews** = friendly tone, no challenging\n",
    "- **Emotional manipulation** = fear-mongering, outrage\n",
    "- **Defensive responses** = indicators of difficult topics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technologies We'll Use\n",
    "- **librosa**: Audio feature extraction (pitch, energy, tempo)\n",
    "- **speechbrain**: Pre-trained emotion recognition models\n",
    "- **Our diarization data**: To tie emotions to specific speakers"
